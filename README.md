# ORE CLI

A command line interface for ORE cryptocurrency mining.

## Install

To install the CLI, use [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```sh
cargo install ore-cli
```

## Build

To build the codebase from scratch, checkout the repo and use cargo to build:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Help

You can use the `-h` flag on any command to pull up a help menu with documentation:

```sh
ore -h
```

This repository is made for $ORE mining purpose on CLI with bash script. $ORE is a mineable token on  Solana blockchain that uses a novel proof-of-work algorithm to guarantee casual miners can never be starved out from earning rewards. You can mine it using your computer or through your phone (anywhere). You can checkout more about token explanation in their [X](https://twitter.com/OreSupply/status/1775176540340547818) and [website](https://ore.supply/).

## How to Start

Here is step by step how to mine $ORE in your computer using terminal (either powershell or WSL terminal it's up to you) or using termux on your phone. You can also run this on cloud-hosted service such as VPS, but make sure your VPS is allowed to do cryptocurrency mining activity.

### 0. Make folder first
Use command below before installing Rust if you use cloud-hosted environment. If you are using local environment, you can skip this part.
```
mkdir -p /home/<your-cloud-environment>/.config/fish/conf.d/
```

### 1. Install Rust and Cargo:
Install Rust and Cargo through curl command line. You can see details about its installation on [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### 2. Install Solana CLI, then export PATH to verify your Solana CLI:
After installed Rust and Cargo, install Solana CLI with command below. Dont forget to export the path or restart the terminal after installing Solana CLI.
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.4/install)"

export PATH="/home/<path>/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

### 3. Create a new solana wallet:
Create a new solana wallet on your CLI. Alternatively, if you want to import solana wallet you can use `solana-keygen recover` instead.
```
solana-keygen new
```
### 4. Find your Solana address and send 0.01 SOL on your address:
Assuming 0.01 SOL is enough and optimal for mining later on. You can deposit more SOL if you want.
```
solana-keygen pubkey
```

### 4. Add $ORE contract address to the wallet:
Add $ORE token on your solana CLI, it will cost SOL gasfee.
```
spl-token create-account oreoN2tQbHXVaZsr3pf66A48miqcBXCDJozganhEJgz
```

### 6. Install the Ore CLI:
There is plenty way to install Ore CLI. 
```
cargo install ore-cli
```
You can also clone the source and build from it.
```
git clone https://github.com/HardhatChad/ore-cli.git
cd ore-cli
cargo build --release
```

### 7. Choosing RPC
You can use different Solana RPC endpoints such as Alchemy, Helius, or Solana Mainnet RPC. Here is the list of RPC examples you can use
- https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/solana)
- [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/)
- [Triton](https://triton.one/)
- [Syndica](https://syndica.io/)
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/solana)
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/solana/)
- [GetBlock](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/)
- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-solana/)
- [Blockdaemon](https://www.blockdaemon.com/protocols/solana)
- [OMNIA](https://omniatech.io/pages/solana-rpc/)
- [Hello Moon](https://www.hellomoon.io/developers)
- [EXTR](https://extrnode.com/solana/)
- [Ironforge](https://ore.supply/settings)

### 8. Clone My Repo
Clone my github repo and go the repo folder
```
git clone https://github.com/0xrsydn/ore-miner.git
cd ore-miner
```

### 9. Configure The Script
You should configure and modify the script (oreminer.sh) first such as adding rpc endpoints, adding public key path, configure cpu threads, etc. You could also create a lot of oreminer bash scripts with different rpc endpoints and configurations. After finishing your configuration, make the script executable:
```
chmod +x oreminer.sh claimbalance.sh unclaimedbalance.sh
```

### 10. Run The Script
Stay in that folder and execute oreminer.sh and watch your machine mine ORE for you automatically:
```
./oreminer.sh
```

### 11. Additional information
You can checkout other bash scripts such as claimbalance.sh for claim $ORE, unclaimedbalance.sh for checking unclaimed balance, and checkore.sh to check your $ORE balance.
